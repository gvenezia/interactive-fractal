# Interactive Fractal Animation
This React application generates a tree-like fractal animation that can be manipulated by the user.

## How Was It Built?
I use the [React Armory tutorial](https://reactarmory.com/guides/learn-react-by-itself/react-basics) as a boilerplate, then add my own functionality on top.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version of the guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
